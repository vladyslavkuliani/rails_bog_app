### Overview

Everyone does blog apps. Now, you're going to work on a **bog app**. Researchers are collecting data on a local bog and need an app to quickly record field data.

### Objectives

It's time to put all your Rails knowledge into practice! In this project, you will:

- Review **CRUD** in the context of a Rails application.  
- Implement **form helpers** in a  Rails application.  
- Build memory for the steps required to create a Rails app.


### Workflow

You'll work through this project as a "time trial." You will be building the app 4 times, each time gaining skills through repetition. Here's how we want you to work:

  1. Start by making a `first-run` branch: `git checkout -b first-run`. Move through the instructions below to build your bog app. Use as many hints as you'd like to check your work and make sure you get through the lab smoothly. Commit your work along the way and at the conclusion. If you get stuck at any point, feel free to reference the [solution branch](../../tree/solution).
  2. Reset your progress to the beginning by checking out master again `git checkout master` then make a `second-run` branch: `git checkout -b second-run`. Go through the lab another time. This time, time yourself on how long it takes you. Push yourself to peek at the hints more sparingly and code as much as you can on your own. Try not reference the solutions branch; you can look at your own first branch if you're stuck.  Again, make sure to commit your work.
  3. Reset your progress to the beginning by checking out master again `git checkout master` then make a `third-run` branch: `git checkout -b third-run`. Repeat the lab a third time. Try not to use the instructions to build your bog app and refer to them only when very stuck. Time yourself again and aim to build the app faster than you built it the second time around. Make sure you have roughly the same number of commits as you had on your second run. Version control isn't the place to cut corners!
  4. Reset your progress to the beginning by checking out master again `git checkout master` then make a `fourth-run` branch: `git checkout -b fourth-run`. Time yourself. This is the fourth time; streamline your process. Squash bugs faster and try not to look at the resources. Commit often and build it as fast as you can!

### Submission

When you're finished with your timed runs, edit the README on your master branch with an introduction paragraph that includes:

 - a 3-5 sentences reflection on how this went for you  
 - a tip for others to help conquer some part of the app that used to trip you up  
 - the times for your first and fourth runs     

Add a link to your bog app repo on the "My Work" section of your personal website.



## Background

> A bog is a mire that accumulates peat, a deposit of dead plant material — often mosses.

You may hear bog and think of Yoda and Luke...

## CRUD and REST Reference

REST stands for **REpresentational State Transfer**. We will strictly adhere to RESTful routing for Rails.

| Verb | Path | Action | Used for |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GET | /creatures | index | displaying list of all creatures |
| GET | /creatures/new | new | displaying an HTML form to create a new creature |
| POST | /creatures | create | creating a new creature in the database |
| GET | /creatures/:id | show | displaying a specific creature |
| GET | /creatures/:id/edit | edit | displaying an HTML form to edit a specific creature |
| PUT or PATCH | /creatures/:id | update | updating a specific creature in the database |
| DELETE | /creatures/:id | destroy | deleting a specific creature in the database |

## Part I: Display all creatures with `index`

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/58b675eee577ccb1f4b57b14e58761b3fa56a3b8/687474703a2f2f692e67697068792e636f6d2f313149334f7346524c6b514951552e676966)

#### 1. Set up a new Rails project

Fork this repo, and clone it into your wdi folder on your local machine. Change directories into `rails-bog-app`, and create a new Rails project:

```zsh
➜  rails new bog_app -T -d postgresql
➜  cd bog_app
➜  rails db:create
➜  rails s
```

Your app should be up and running at `localhost:3000`.

#### 2. Add Bootstrap to your project

Rails handles CSS and JavaScript with a system called the asset pipeline. We'll go over it more next week, but for now, here's how to add Bootstrap CSS using the asset pipeline.

Third-party libraries belong in the `vendor/assets` sub-directory of your Rails app. You'll need to download a Bootstrap CSS file and add it to this directory.  

One way you can do that is to use the following Terminal command to download the Bootstrap CSS file (via `curl`) and save it in a new `bootstrap-3.3.6.min.css` file inside the `vendor/assets/stylesheets` sub-directory. You may want to find and use the most recent version of Bootstrap if it's no longer 3.3.6.

```zsh
➜  curl https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css > vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap-3.3.6.min.css
```
You should see that that file is now in your project's directory.

To include the CSS from the Bootstrap file you just downloaded into your pages, require it in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

```css
/*
 * app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
 */

/*
 *
 *= require bootstrap-3.3.6.min
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self
 */
```

#### 3. Define the `root` and creatures `index` routes

In your text editor, open up `config/routes.rb`. Inside the routes `draw` block, erase all the commented text.

> _You're about to see a hint! Throughout the instructions, there will be hints like this one that show you parts of the code. When you're running through the project a second time, try to use these less. The third time, try not to use them at all._

<details>
  <summary>Hint: `routes.rb` should now look exactly like this...</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  # config/routes.rb
  #
  Rails.application.routes.draw do

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>
<br>

Your routes tell your app how to direct **HTTP requests** to **controller actions**. Define your `root` route and your creatures `index` route to refer to the index method in the creatures controller:

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  # config/routes.rb
  #

  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    root "creatures#index"

    get "/creatures", to: "creatures#index", as: "creatures"

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>



In the Terminal, running `rails routes` will list all your routes. You'll see that some routes have a "prefix" listed. These routes have associated route helpers, which are methods Rails creates to generate URLs. The format of a route helper is `prefix_path`. For example, `creatures_path` is the full route helper for `GET /creatures` (the creatures index). We often use route helpers to generate URLs in forms, links, and controllers.

#### 4. Set up the creatures controller and `index` action

Run the following command in the Terminal to generate a controller for creatures:

```zsh
➜  rails g controller creatures
```

Next, define the `creatures#index` action in the creatures controller. The variable `@creatures` should be all of the creatures in the db:

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #
  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController
  # display all creatures
    def index
      # get all creatures from db and save to instance variable
      @creatures = Creature.all
      # render the index view (it has access to instance variable)
      # remember the default behavior is to render :index
    end
  end
  ```
</details>




#### 5. Set up the creature model

Run the following command in the Terminal to generate the `Creature` model:

```zsh
➜  rails g model creature name description
```

Run the migration to update the database with this change:

```zsh
➜  rails db:migrate
```

#### 6. Create a creature

In the Terminal, enter the Rails console. The Rails console is built on top of `irb`, and it has access to your Rails project. Use it to create a new instance of a creature.  This just lets us confirm that the model class is set up and the migration has run successfully.

```zsh
➜  rails c
irb(main):001:0> Creature.create({name: "Yoda", description: "Little green man"})
```

#### 7. Seed your database

When you create an application in development, you typically want some mock data to play with. In Rails, you can just drop this into the `db/seeds.rb` file.

Back in Atom, add some seed data to `db/seeds.rb`:

```ruby
#
# db/seeds.rb
#

Creature.create({name: "Luke", description: "Jedi"})
Creature.create({name: "Darth Vader", description: "Father of Luke"})
```

In the Terminal (not inside rails console!), run `rails db:seed`. Note that the seed file will also run every time you run `rails db:reset` to reset your database.

#### 8. Set up the creatures `index` view

If you look inside the `app/views` directory, the `/creatures` folder has already been created (this happened when you ran `rails g controller creatures`). Add an `index.html.erb` file to the `app/views/creatures` folder.

Inside your creatures index view, iterate through all the creatures in the database, and display them on the page:

<details>
  <summary>Here's one way that could look:</summary>
  <p>
  ```html
  <!-- app/views/creatures/index.html.erb -->

  <% @creatures.each do |creature| %>
    <p>
      <strong>Name:</strong> <%= creature.name %><br>
      <strong>Description:</strong> <%= creature.description %>
    </p>
  <% end %>
  ```
  </p>
</details>
<br>

#### 9. Update the layout to use Bootstrap classes.

Bootstrap is set up in this project, but it's not used yet.  In your application's main layout (`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`), add the basic structure container/row/column structure Bootstrap uses, around the `<%= yield %>`.

<details>
  <summary>Here's one way that could look:</summary>
  <p>
  ```html
  <!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb -->
  <!--  ...  -->
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
          <%= yield %>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
  ```
  </p>
</details>
<br>

Go to `localhost:3000` in the browser. What do you see on the page? If you haven't already, `git add` and `git commit` the work you've done so far.

## Part II: Make a creature with `new` (form) and `create` (database)


<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/jnVeAppOL9te0/giphy.gif">


#### 1. Define a route for the `new` creature form

The Rails convention is to make a form for new creatures at the `/creatures/new` path in our browser.

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  #/config/routes.rb
  #

  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    root to: "creatures#index"

    get "/creatures", to: "creatures#index", as: "creatures"
    get "/creatures/new", to: "creatures#new", as: "new_creature"
  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>
<br>

#### 2. Set up the creatures `new` action

When a user sends a GET request to `/creatures/new`, your server will search for a `creatures#new` action, so you need to create a controller method to handle this request. `creatures#new` should render the view `new.html.erb` inside the `app/views/creatures` folder.

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #

  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController

    ...

    # show the new creature form
    def new
      # remember the default behavior is to render :new
    end

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

#### 3. Set up the view for the new creature form

Create the view `new.html.erb` inside the `app/views/creatures` folder. On this view, users should see a form to create new creatures in the database.

<details>
  <summary>Here's one way that could look:</summary>
  <p>
  ```html
  <!-- app/views/creatures/new.html.erb -->

  <%= form_for :creature, url: "/creatures", method: "post" do |f| %>
    <%= f.text_field :name %>
    <%= f.text_area :description %>
    <%= f.submit "Save Creature" %>
  <% end %>
  ```
  </p>
</details>

**Note:** The URL you're submitting the form to is `/creatures` because it's the database collection for creatures, and the method is `post` because you're *creating* a new creature.

Go to `localhost:3000/creatures/new` in the browser, and inspect the HTML for the form on the page. `form_for` is a "form helper", and it generates more than what you might guess from the `erb` you wrote in the view. Note the `method` and `action` in the form - what route do you think you should define next?

#### 4. Define a route to `create` creatures in the database

Your new creature form has `action="/creatures"` and `method="POST"`. The `POST /creatures` route doesn't exist yet, so go ahead and create it!

<details>
  <summary> Hint:</summary>
  <p>

  ```ruby
  #
  #/config/routes.rb
  #

  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    root to: "creatures#index"

    get "/creatures", to: "creatures#index", as: "creatures"
    get "/creatures/new", to: "creatures#new", as: "new_creature"
    post "/creatures", to: "creatures#create"

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

#### 5. Set up the creatures `create` action

The `POST /creatures` maps to the `creatures#create` controller action, so the next step is to define the controller method to handle this request. `creatures#create` should add a new creature to the database.

<details>
  <summary>The code:</summary>
  <p>

  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #

  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController

    # ...

    # create a new creature in the database
    def create
      # whitelist params and save them to a variable
      creature_params = params.require(:creature).permit(:name, :description)

      # create a new creature from `creature_params`
      creature = Creature.new(creature_params)

      # if creature saves, redirect to route that displays all creatures
      if creature.save
        redirect_to creatures_path
        # redirect_to creatures_path is equivalent to:
        # redirect_to "/creatures"
      end
    end
  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

#### 6. Refactor the `new` creature form

Update your `creatures#new` action to send a new instance of a `Creature` to the new creature form.

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>

  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #

  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController

    ...

    # show the new creature form
    def new
      @creature = Creature.new
      # remember the default behavior is to render :new
    end

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

This sets `@creature` to a new instance of a `Creature`, which is automatically shared with the form in `views/creatures/new.html.erb`. This allows you to refactor the code for the `form_for` helper.

<details>
  <summary>It might look something like this:</summary>
  <p>
  ```html
  <!-- app/views/creatures/new.html.erb -->

  <%= form_for @creature do |f| %>
    <%= f.text_field :name %>
    <%= f.text_area :description %>
    <%= f.submit "Save Creature" %>
  <% end %>
  ```
  </p>
</details>

Go to `localhost:3000/creatures/new` again in the browser, and inspect the HTML for the form on the page. Did anything change?

#### 7. Define a route to `show` a specific creature

Right now, your app redirects to `/creatures` after creating a new creature, and the new creature shows up at the bottom of the page. Let's make a route for users to see a specific creature. Then, you'll be able to show a new creature by itself right after it's created.

First, define a `show` route.

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  # config/routes.rb
  #

  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    root to: "creatures#index"

    get "/creatures", to: "creatures#index", as: "creatures"
    get "/creatures/new", to: "creatures#new", as: "new_creature"
    post "/creatures", to: "creatures#create"
    get "/creatures/:id", to: "creatures#show", as: "creature"
  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

Now that you have your `show` route, set up the controller action for `creatures#show`.

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>

  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #

  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController

    ...

    # display a specific creature
    def show
      # get the creature id from the url params
      creature_id = params[:id]

      # use `creature_id` to find the creature in the database
      # and save it to an instance variable
      @creature = Creature.find_by_id(creature_id)

      # render the show view (it has access to instance variable)
      # remember the default behavior is to render :show
    end

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

Next, create the view to display a single creature:

<details>
  <summary>It might look like this:</summary>
  <p>
  ```html
  <!-- app/views/creatures/show.html.erb -->

  <h3><%= @creature.name %></h3>
  <p><%=  @creature.description %></p>
  ```
  </p>
</details>

#### 8. Refactor the `creatures#create` redirect

The `creatures#create` method currently redirects to `/creatures`. Again, this isn't very helpful for users who want to verify that they successfully created a *single* creature. The best way to fix this is to have it redirect to `/creatures/:id` instead.

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #

  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController

    ...

    # create a new creature in the database
    def create
      # whitelist params and save them to a variable
      creature_params = params.require(:creature).permit(:name, :description)

      # create a new creature from `creature_params`
      creature = Creature.new(creature_params)

      # if creature saves, redirect to route that displays
      # ONLY the newly created creature
      if creature.save
        redirect_to creature_path(creature)
        # redirect_to creature_path(creature) is equivalent to:
        # redirect_to "/creatures/#{creature.id}"
      end
    end

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

Make sure to `git add` and `git commit` again once you have `new`, `create`, and `show` working.

## Part III: Change a creature with `edit` (form) and `update` (database)

<img src="https://aos.iacpublishinglabs.com/question/aq/700px-394px/how-long-is-a-caterpillar-in-a-cocoon_095bed7c-a98c-486d-b938-48e0b7ce39f2.jpg?domain=cx.aos.ask.com" width="70%">

<!-- ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9f3f575f52088b41954636a670b1d44b3eac9fb9/687474703a2f2f692e67697068792e636f6d2f31324b7856766a35415232556e652e676966)   -->

**Don't Give Up!!!**

Editing a specific creature requires two methods:

* `edit` displays a form with the existing creature info to be edited by the user
* `update` changes the creature info in the database when the user submits the form

#### 1. Define a route for the `edit` creature form

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  # config/routes.rb
  #

  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    root to: "creatures#index"

    get "/creatures", to: "creatures#index", as: "creatures"
    get "/creatures/new", to: "creatures#new", as: "new_creature"
    post "/creatures", to: "creatures#create"
    get "/creatures/:id", to: "creatures#show", as: "creature"
    get "/creatures/:id/edit", to: "creatures#edit", as: "edit_creature"
  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

#### 2. Set up the creatures `edit` action

Using your `creatures#new` and `creatures#show` method as inspiration, you can write the `creatures#edit` method in the creatures controller:

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #

  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController

    ...

    # show the edit creature form
    def edit
      # get the creature id from the url params
      creature_id = params[:id]

      # use `creature_id` to find the creature in the database
      # and save it to an instance variable
      @creature = Creature.find_by_id(creature_id)

      # render the edit view (it has access to instance variable)
      # remember the default behavior is to render :edit
    end

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

#### 3. Set up the view for the edit creature form

Create an `edit.html.erb` view inside `views/creatures`. Jump-start the edit form by copying the form from `views/creatures/new.html.erb` into `views/creatures/edit.html.erb`:

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```html
  <!-- app/views/creatures/edit.html.erb -->

  <%= form_for @creature do |f| %>
    <%= f.text_field :name %>
    <%= f.text_area :description %>
    <%= f.submit "Save Creature" %>
  <% end %>
  ```
  </p>
</details>

Go to `localhost:3000/creatures/1/edit` in the browser to see what it looks like so far.  Check the `method` and `action` of the form. Also look at the hidden input with `name="_method"`.  What is it doing? The Rails form helper knows to turn this same code into an edit form because you're on the edit page!

#### 4. Define a route to `update` a specific creature

The update route will use the `id` of the creature to be updated. In Express, you decided between `PUT /creatures/:id` and `PATCH /creatures/:id`, depending on the type of update you wanted to do. In Rails, we'll need to add `PATCH /creatures/:id` only to our routes.

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  # config/routes.rb
  #

  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    root to: "creatures#index"

    get "/creatures", to: "creatures#index", as: "creatures"
    get "/creatures/new", to: "creatures#new", as: "new_creature"
    post "/creatures", to: "creatures#create"
    get "/creatures/:id", to: "creatures#show", as: "creature"
    get "/creatures/:id/edit", to: "creatures#edit", as: "edit_creature"
    patch "/creatures/:id", to: "creatures#update"
  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

Run `rails routes` in the Terminal to see the newly created update routes.

#### 5. Set up the creatures `update` action

In the `CreaturesController`, define an `update` method:

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>

  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #

  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController

    ...

    # update a creature in the database
    def update
      # get the creature id from the url params
      creature_id = params[:id]

      # use `creature_id` to find the creature in the database
      creature = Creature.find_by_id(creature_id)

      # whitelist params and save them to a variable
      creature_params = params.require(:creature).permit(:name, :description)

      # update the creature
      creature.update_attributes(creature_params)

      # redirect to show page for the updated creature
      redirect_to creature_path(creature)
      # redirect_to creature_path(creature) is equivalent to:
      # redirect_to "/creatures/#{creature.id}"
    end

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

#### 6. Refactor whitelisted `params`.

Now that `params` are whitelisted in two different places in the `CreaturesController`, refactor so that these params are set up in their own method.   This method can (and should!) be `private` because it will only ever be used inside the `CreaturesController` class definition.

  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #

  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController

    ...

    # update a creature in the database
    def update
      # get the creature id from the url params
      creature_id = params[:id]

      # use `creature_id` to find the creature in the database
      # and save it to an instance variable
      creature = Creature.find_by_id(creature_id)

      # update the creature
      creature.update_attributes(creature_params)  # this now calls the private method below!

      # redirect to show page for the updated creature
      redirect_to creature_path(creature)
      # redirect_to creature_path(creature) is equivalent to:
      # redirect_to "/creatures/#{creature.id}"
    end

    private

    def creature_params
      # whitelist params return whitelisted version
      params.require(:creature).permit(:name, :description)
    end

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

Refactor the `create` action to use this private method as well.


Manually re-test your `creatures#create` method in the browser. Then, test your `creatures#update` method in the browser by editing the creature with an `id` of 1 (go to `localhost:3000/creatures/1/edit`). Then, `git add` and `git commit` your work.

## Part IV: Delete a creature with `destroy` (database)

#### 1. Define a route to `destroy` a specific creature

Following a similar pattern to our other routes, create a route to `destroy` (delete) a specific creature based on its `id`.

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>

  ```ruby
  #
  # config/routes.rb
  #

  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    root to: "creatures#index"

    get "/creatures", to: "creatures#index", as: "creatures"
    get "/creatures/new", to: "creatures#new", as: "new_creature"
    post "/creatures", to: "creatures#create"
    get "/creatures/:id", to: "creatures#show", as: "creature"
    get "/creatures/:id/edit", to: "creatures#edit", as: "edit_creature"
    patch "/creatures/:id", to: "creatures#update"
    delete "/creatures/:id", to: "creatures#destroy"
  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

At this point, you're using all the RESTful routes for creatures.


#### 2. Set up the creatures `destroy` action

In the `CreaturesController`, define an `destroy` method:

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  <p>
  ```ruby
  #
  # app/controllers/creatures_controller.rb
  #

  class CreaturesController < ApplicationController

    ...

    # delete a creature from the database
    def destroy
      # get the creature id from the url params
      creature_id = params[:id]

      # use `creature_id` to find the creature in the database
      # and save it to an instance variable
      creature = Creature.find_by_id(creature_id)

      # destroy the creature
      creature.destroy

      # redirect to creatures index
      redirect_to creatures_path
      # redirect_to creatures_path is equivalent to:
      # redirect_to "/creatures"
    end

  end
  ```
  </p>
</details>

#### 3. Add a delete button

Add a delete button to the view that displays a single creature:
<details>
  <summary>It could look something like:</summary>
  <p>

```html
<!-- app/views/creatures/show.html.erb -->

<h3><%= @creature.name %></h3>
<p><%=  @creature.description %></p>
<%= button_to "Delete", @creature, method: :delete %>
```
  </p>
</details>

Visit `localhost:3000/creatures/1` in the browser, and inspect the HTML for the delete button. Click the delete button to manually test this feature.

At this point, you've created all the RESTful routes, implemented controller actions for each route, and made views for `index`, `show`, `new`, and `edit`. You've also created the `Creature` model in the database and manually tested that everything works.

## Additional Development Ideas

* Add links to other pages to help users navigate your site. For instance, a creature show page might have a link to the creatures index page. Use `link_to`.  Also link each creature on `creatures#index` to its individual `show` page.
* If you'd like, add a Bootstrap `navbar` with links to the homepage (`/`) and the new creatures page (`/creatures/new`). This navbar should show up on every page.
* Read about [Active Record Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html), and add validations to the `Creature` model to make sure a new creature can't be created without a `name` and `description`.
* Read the docs for the [Paperclip gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip), and incorporate it into your Bog App to upload photos of creatures locally.


## CONGRATULATIONS! You have created a Bog App! Take a break, you look *Swamped*!
